🚧 AI-Based Rockfall Prediction and Alert System

An advanced AI-powered safety solution designed to predict potential rockfall hazards in mining and construction sites. The system integrates a Python FastAPI machine learning model for rockfall prediction with a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack for real-time monitoring, visualization, and alert management.

📌 Features

🔮 AI/ML Prediction – Uses a trained ML model to predict the probability of rockfalls.

⚡ Real-Time Alerts – Sends instant notifications to workers/admins in case of high-risk predictions.

🗺️ Interactive Dashboard – Web-based dashboard with charts, reports, and monitoring tools.

📍 Geospatial Mapping – Location-based visualization using Leaflet.js / Map APIs.

👨‍💻 Role-Based Authentication – Secure access for admins, supervisors, and workers.

📊 Data Visualization – Historical data analysis with charts (Recharts/D3.js).

🔗 Seamless Integration – FastAPI ML model communicates with Node.js backend via REST APIs.
